# Phase-Locked-Loop
It is an exciting way to explore different aspects of our stream Electronics and Communication like control system analysis, modelling and testing of circuits in analog and digital electronics. It can resolve various design problems such as jitter reduction, skew suppression, frequency synthesis and clock recovery. This project aims to successfully implement a Charge-Pump Based PLL (CP-PLL) circuit and compare the effects of different Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO)s on the performance of PLL considering the following parameters: Power consumption, phase noise, gain linearity and jitter.

Implementation of a PLL requires the design of various blocks which are as follows: Phase Detector, Charge Pump, Loop filter, VCO and Frequency Divider Circuit.  Industry grade VLSI tools and technologies will be used in this project to implement different blocks on circuit level. The following specifications are required to be achieved using 180 nm CMOS technology:  Total power budget in the range of 20 mW-40 mW, tuning range of 500 MHz-1 GHz, jitter less than 25 ps.
